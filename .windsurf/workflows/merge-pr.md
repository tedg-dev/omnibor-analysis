description: Merge a feature branch into main (execute after user approves the PR)

# Merge PR Workflow

Once the user explicitly approves merging a feature branch, execute **all** of the
following steps in sequence without pausing for confirmation between them.

## Prerequisites

- The user has explicitly approved the merge
- You are currently on the feature branch with all changes committed and pushed

## Steps (execute all in one go)

// turbo
1. Switch to main and pull latest:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

// turbo
2. Merge the feature branch with a no-fast-forward merge:
```bash
git merge --no-ff <BRANCH_NAME> -m "<COMMIT_MESSAGE>"
```

Use the same commit message as the feature branch commit (conventional commit format).

// turbo
3. Push main to origin:
```bash
git push origin main
```

// turbo
4. Delete the feature branch locally:
```bash
git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>
```

// turbo
5. Delete the feature branch on the remote:
```bash
git push origin --delete <BRANCH_NAME>
```

// turbo
6. Verify:
```bash
git log --oneline -3
git branch -a
```

## Important

- **Do NOT pause between steps** — once the user approves, run all commands sequentially
- If any step fails, stop and report the error to the user
- The merge commit message should use conventional commit format matching the branch work
